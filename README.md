# Stock_Markets_Assymetric_Volatility_Spillover_Effects
In this research, I investigated the Asymmetric Volatility Spillover Effects within and across six major international stock markets indexes namely United States (S&P 500), Canada (TSX 60), France (CAC 40), Germany (DAX 40), Italy (MIB 30) & Japan (NIKKEI 225) on 23 years of time series dataset (1999 - 2022)


# Finding & Insights:
My findings reveal that volatility spillovers are asymmetric, with the largest impact being auto-influence. Canada has the least impact on the other five countries, while Japan and the United States experience the least cross-influence volatility from abroad (most resilient). Italy is most impacted by external volatility changes. In order to realistically and accurately predict volatility, investors' expectations are a significant factor. And contrary to Bensaida (2019), the United States maintains dominance with respect to global market influence.
