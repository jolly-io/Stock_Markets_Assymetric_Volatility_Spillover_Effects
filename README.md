# Stock_Markets_Assymetric_Volatility_Spillover_Effects
I investigate the Asymmetric Volatility Spillover Effects within and across major International stock markets.  


Findings reveal that Volatility spillovers are asymmetric, with the largest impact within each market. Canada has the least
impact on other countries, while Japan and the US experience the least volatility from abroad. Italy is most impacted by external volatility changes. In order to predict volatility, investors' expectations play a significant role. In contrast to Bensaida (2019), the United State retains a dominant role as regards to global market
influence.
