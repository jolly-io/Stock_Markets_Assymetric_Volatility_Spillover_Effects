## Stock_Markets_Assymetric_Volatility_Spillover_Effects
In this research, I investigated the Asymmetric Volatility Spillover Effects within and across six major international stock markets indexes namely United States (S&P 500), Canada (TSX 60), France (CAC 40), Germany (DAX 40), Italy (MIB 30) & Japan (NIKKEI 225) on 23 years of time series dataset (1999 - 2022)


## ABSTRACT
My findings reveal that volatility spillovers are asymmetric, with the largest impact being auto-influence. Canada has the least impact on the other five countries, while Japan and the United States experience the least cross-influence volatility from abroad (most resilient). Italy is most impacted by external volatility changes. In order to realistically and accurately predict volatility, investors' expectations are a significant factor. And contrary to Bensaida (2019), the United States maintains dominance with respect to global market influence.


## Purpose
To investigate the Asymmetric Volatility Spillover Effects within and across International stock markets.
Study design/methodology/approach
GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) Model, Markov-switching model,
and Vector Autoregressive Model.


## Findings
Volatility spillovers are asymmetric, with the largest impact being auto-influence. Canada has the least
impact on other countries, while Japan and the US experience the least cross-influence volatility from
abroad. Italy is most impacted by external volatility changes.
In order to realistically and accurately predict volatility, investors' expectations are a significant factor. In
contrast to Bensaida (2019), the United States maintains dominance with respect to global market
influence.


## Originality/value
Existing Literature continues to use either realized volatility or conditional volatility without controlling
for expected return of the market. This leads to overestimated volatility as well as biased spillover
effects. This research combines GARCH and Markov-switching models to capture conditional volatility
and expected return simultaneously. It also contributes to the good and bad volatility literature by
showing that using time-varying expected return as threshold to distinguish good and bad is better than
using 0.


## Practical Implications
Stakeholders in the financial sector (Hedge Funds, Money and Asset managers etc) can leverage findings
and insights from this research to inform investment strategies, risk management and the exploitation of
spillover opportunities. A reliable and robust data ecosystem, highly qualified analysts and organizational
management are required for the implementation, productionization and deployment that leverages findings from this model.
