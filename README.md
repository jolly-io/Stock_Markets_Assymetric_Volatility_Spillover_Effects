# Stock_Markets_Assymetric_Volatility_Spillover_Effects
I investigate the Asymmetric Volatility Spillover Effects within and across major International stock markets.  

Findings reveal that volatility spillovers are asymmetric, with the largest impact being auto-influence. Canada has the least impact on other countries, while Japan and the US experience the least cross-influence volatility from abroad. Italy is most impacted by external volatility changes.
In order to realistically and accurately predict volatility, investors' expectations are a significant factor. In contrast to Bensaida (2019), the United States maintains dominance with respect to global market influence.
